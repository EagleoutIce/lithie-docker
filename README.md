# lithie-docker

Contains the docker-files to compile lithie-documents.

This setup will one of the core components of [sltx](https://github.com/EagleoutIce/sltx), the base-structure was loosely.
The collection-data for texlive may be found [here](https://tug.org/svn/texlive/trunk/Master/tlpkg/tlpsrc/).

Inspired by the container that sltx used previously: [xu-cheng/latex-docker](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-docker).

Other containers will probably be added in the future :D
